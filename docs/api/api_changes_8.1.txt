Changes introduced in AVS 8.1
=============================

There is a new quality value returned from the quality handler (wcall_network_quality_h) in the quality param:

#define WCALL_QUALITY_RECONNECTING    5

This allows clients to present a reconnecting notfication when a client has lost connection and is attempting to reconnect. When the connection has reconnected the quality handler will be called again with WCALL_QUALITY_NORMAL. If reconnecting fails then the close handler (closeh) will be called with a reason and the reconnecting notification should be replaced with a call dropped notification.

The quailty handler will also be called for conference calls, since there is no single remote user for the connection the userid and clientid will be SFT and should be ignored in this case.
